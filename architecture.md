Here is how the same module evolves across the grades in your app:

1. The "Differentiation Matrix" (How the App Changes)
This is the logic we will feed the AI. Notice how the mechanic (Drag & Drop) stays the same, but the content changes.

Module A: The "Shopkeeper" (Math - Profit/Loss/Money)
Stage 1: Primary (Grades 3-5)

Topic: Money Exchange.

Task: "The toy costs ₹15. You give ₹20. How much change do you get?"

Visual: Drag coins and notes.

Stage 2: Middle School (Grades 6-8)

Topic: Profit & Loss.

Task: "CP is ₹100. Set SP to make a 20% Profit."

Visual: Slider bar / Tag editor.

Stage 3: Secondary (Grades 9-10)

Topic: Compound Interest / Tax.

Task: "Calculate the final price with 18% GST compounded annually."

Visual: Graph showing money growth.

Stage 4: Senior Secondary (Grades 11-12)

Topic: Calculus in Economics / Cost Function.

Task: "Find the 'Maximum Profit' point on this curve (Derivatives)."

Visual: Coordinate Geometry Parabola.

Module B: The "Circuit Builder" (Science - Physics)
Stage 1: Primary (Grades 3-5)

Topic: Electricity Flows.

Task: "Connect the wire to make the bulb glow."

Asset Style: Cartoons (Cute bulb with a face, bright yellow wires).

Stage 2: Middle School (Grades 6-8)
